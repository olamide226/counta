## 🔔 Resume Notifications

Counta helps you maintain your practice with smart resume notifications:

### How It Works

When you minimize or background the app during a counting session (count > 0), Counta automatically:

1. **Tracks Your Progress**: Records your current count and session duration
2. **Sends a Notification**: Displays a notification showing:
   - Your current count
   - Session duration
   - A prompt to resume

3. **Resume Seamlessly**: Tap the notification to return to your session exactly where you left off

### Notification Details

- **Title**: "Resume Counting"
- **Content**: "You were at [X] counts. Session duration: [Y]m"
- **Auto-Cancel**: Notifications are automatically cleared when you return to the app
- **Privacy**: All notifications are local - no data is sent to external servers

### Platform-Specific Notes

**iOS/macOS**: 
- Notification permissions are requested on first launch
- You can manage permissions in Settings > Notifications

**Android**:
- Notification permission is requested on Android 13+ (API 33+)
- Notifications use a dedicated "Resume Notifications" channel
- High priority for immediate visibility

### Permissions

The app requires notification permissions to function:
- **Android**: `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` permission (Android 13+)
- **iOS**: Alert, Badge, and Sound permissions

These are requested automatically when the app first launches.

Contributions are welcome! Here's how you can help:

1. **Fork the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/olamide226/counta.git
   cd counta
   ```

2. **Create a feature branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

3. **Make your changes**
   - Follow the existing code style and architecture
   - Use Riverpod for state management
   - Add comments for complex logic
   - Ensure Hive models have proper type adapters

4. **Format your code**
   ```bash
   dart format .
   ```

5. **Run code generation if needed**
   ```bash
   dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
   ```

6. **Test your changes**
   ```bash
   flutter test
   flutter run
   ```

7. **Commit and push**
   ```bash
   git add .

   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

8. **Create a Pull Request**
   - Describe your changes clearly
   - Reference any related issues
   - Include screenshots for UI changes

### Code Guidelines

- **Architecture**: Follow clean architecture principles with domain/data/state/ui separation
- **State Management**: Use Riverpod providers for all state
- **Models**: Annotate with Hive type adapters for persistence
- **UI**: Use Material 3 components and respect theme colors
- **Platform Support**: Test on both iOS and Android for haptic/audio features
- **Accessibility**: Consider screen readers and semantic labels

### Areas for Contribution

- [x] Unit tests for counter logic and alert service
- [ ] Integration tests for session workflows
- [ ] Custom sound files for tap feedback
- [ ] Additional theme color schemes
- [ ] Accessibility improvements
- [ ] Localization/internationalization
- [ ] Widget animations (count bump, milestone celebration)
- [ ] Export sessions to CSV/JSON

## 🧪 Testing

The project includes comprehensive unit tests for core business logic. Run tests using:

```bash
make test              # Run all tests
make test-coverage     # Run tests with coverage report
```

### Test Coverage

**Current Coverage: ~27%** (51 tests passing)

While overall coverage is moderate, **all critical business logic is thoroughly tested**:

**✅ Fully Tested Components:**
- **CounterProvider** (13 tests) - Core counter logic, increment/decrement, reset, session management
- **CounterAlertService** (16 tests) - Alert triggering at thresholds and repeat intervals
- **Domain Models** (26 tests) - AppSettings, CountSession, CounterState, Enums validation
- **ThemeRegistry** (8 tests) - All 5 color themes in light/dark modes

**⚠️ Not Covered:**
- UI screens/widgets (requires complex Flutter widget testing)
- Hive data persistence layer (requires database mocking)
- Platform-specific services (haptic feedback, audio playback)

The core application logic that determines app behavior is well-tested and reliable. UI components are manually tested during development.
